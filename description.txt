Part B: Web Development

Pauline does not have her own website currently, she would like you to set up a sample “home” page which has information on the Bed & Breakfast, e.g. the different rooms and their features. A table can be used to hold images of the different rooms - all room images should be the same size. The page can also promote the additional services offered e.g. the outdoor excursions.

Headings, paragraphs and hyperlinks should also be used appropriately and the webpage should be designed with accessibility in mind.

How you design the page is entirely up to you - BUT it should follow general good web design principes, e.g. keep it simple, don’t overuse bright colours etc.

Content Styles

Aim to use a wide range of the tags Use both inline and internal CSS specified on the HTML Cheat sheet
